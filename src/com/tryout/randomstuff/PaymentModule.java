	/**
	 * Payments Module
This module is used for charging your customers.
This being a payment system, absolutely no errors are allowed (double charging the end-customers etc).
Interacts with third-party service called payment gateway to do the actual payment processing.
A payment method (Card, PayPal etc) is needed for payment processing.
You should support payment processing against a stored payment method (returning customers / recurring charges etc) as well as new ones (i.e payment method is obtained at the point of charging, and they are not stored - one time purchases).
Your module should be easily able to work with multiple payment gateway types.
You should be able to support new payment method types in future -  VisaCheckout etc.
You should be able to support Delayed payments. i.e payment will not settle immediately. Will take few hours / days to know the final status (like ACH).
